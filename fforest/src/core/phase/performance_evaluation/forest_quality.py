""" Compute a quality's forest vector for each triangular norm chosed. A quality's forest vector map each tree of the
forest to its quality. It exists many ways to compute the quality of a tree. The main one sum all instances' score then
divide this sum by the number of instances to normalize the result. An instance score is the product of its difficult
by the % of membership found by the tree. Theses quality's forest vectors will be dumped into the subtrain directory.
